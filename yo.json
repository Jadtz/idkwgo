    "description": "Young horror writer “Bambi” (pen name: Kojika Kanoko; gender: male) never believed in the supernatural and therefore had no issue with moving into an apartment where a suicide had taken place. After his serialisation was discontinued, he was asked to start writing a short story based on actual experience. He then noticed a spirit in his apartment, an amnesiac high school girl by the name of “Ako.” Since Ako was a relatively friendly and talkitive spirit, not to mention harmless, with her permission, Bambi used her as a model for his next work. But there’s another “Ako,” Yamashiro Ako, a gloomy high school girl who dreams every night from the spirit’s perspective.",
